                    <p class="history">
                        &emsp;&emsp;Resting at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains, and overlooking the largest inland
                        lake in the western US, Salt Lake City is home to a pioneering past, and an exciting future.
                        <br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;Prior to settling the Salt Lake Valley in 1847 by pioneers of the Church of Jesus
                        Christ of Latter-day Saints, it was home to the Ute and Shoshone Indians. The opening of the
                        mining
                        industry in the early 1860s and completion (1870) of the Utah Central Railroad, led it to be the
                        "Crossroads of the West" with its thriving hub of Western commerce. The cityâ€™s population grew
                        steadily
                        from that point on, leading it to be the contemporary city it is today. <br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;Today, Salt Laky City has an estimated population of about 200,567, and an estimated
                        population
                        of about 1,222,540 living within Salt Lake County. This rising population isn't surprising with
                        all of the
                        wonderful commodities that surround the city. With a quick 20-30 minute drive to Park City, you
                        will have
                        what many call "The Greatest Snow on Earth". Downtown Salt Lake offers a growing performing art
                        scene,
                        and a wide variety of award winning culinary experiences. A little further south, and you'll run
                        into the
                        "Silicon Slopes" with its growing tech scene. <br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;Whether you're here to visit or to stay, Salt Lake City will surprise your with the
                        places to see
