                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    Our target audience are all adults, regardless of age, race,
                    or educational background. The weather affects all people, and 
                    we believe that everybody should have the tools necessary to help plan 
                    their daily lives by knowing what the weather will be like that day.
                    This is why we've designed our website to be easily accessible on mobile phones, 
                    tablets and computers. It will also help them to learn about recent news 
                    and upcoming events in the area.

                    <b>-Jonathan Lawrence</b><br>
                    Jonathan (Johnny), is a 20 year old Sophomore at a local community college in Preston, Idaho. 
                    He's currently working on completing his general education classes before transferring to a 
                    university. He plans on getting a degree in Software Engineering and then applying for an internship
                    with any of the big tech companies in the Silicon Valley in California. However, when he isn't busy with 
                    school, he enjoyes playing video games, and also being active outdoors. He and some friends play pickup 
                    basketball a few nights a week at a nearby park. He also likes playing golf. During the wintertime when it's 
                    too cold to play golf and pickup basketball, he and his friends will grab their gear and head up to the 
                    ski slopes at least twice a month to snowboard. As a result of being outdoors so often, 
                    Johnny uses his phone multiple times a week to see what the weather is going to be like. This allows him and 
                    his friends to know if they'll be able to beat some people at basketball at the park, or if they'll 
                    spend an all nighter playing video games.

                    <b>-Suzanne Williams</b><br>
                    Suzanne is a 65 year old mother of 3, and grandmother of 14. She lives 
                    in a rural part of Preston, Idaho with her husband of 40 years. She works as a 
                    receptionist at the local hospital, but hopes to finally be able to retire in 2 years.
                    When she isn't working, she enjoys going on early morning walks with her husband, and 
                    6 year old dog, named Doug the Pug. She also likes gardening, but takes pride in her 
                    rose bushes. While Suzanne uses a computer each day at work, she doesn't care too much 
                    for technology. She has a simple smart phone which she uses to keep in tough with her children 
                    and grandchildren with, and an iPad that her husband had bought for her last Christmas to be 
                    able to read her books on. She began to use the tablet to check the weather daily in order to 
                    prepare herself for her daily walks, and to also better take care of her rose bushes.
